PORTFOLIO PROJECTS SECTION - OVERLAY STYLE UPDATE
===================================================================

Your portfolio now has a modern overlay-style projects section!

WHAT'S NEW:
-----------
âœ“ Hover-activated overlay effects on project cards
âœ“ "View Details" button that opens a modal with full information
âœ“ Beautiful image backgrounds for each project
âœ“ Smooth animations and transitions
âœ“ Mobile-responsive design

HOW TO USE:
-----------
1. Open `projects-section.html` - This contains the complete new projects section
2. Copy EVERYTHING from that file
3. In your main `index.html`, find the projects section (starts with `<!-- Projects Section -->`)
4. Replace the ENTIRE projects section with the content from `projects-section.html`
5. Save and refresh your browser!

FILES CREATED:
--------------
1. projects-section.html - New projects HTML (copy this into your index.html)
2. projects-overlay.css - Styles for the new design (already linked in HTML)
3. projects-modal.js - JavaScript for modal functionality (already linked in HTML)
4. INSTRUCTIONS.txt - This file

FEATURES:
---------
â€¢ Hover over any project card to see the gradient overlay effect

  - Technologies Used
â€¢ Click the X button or press ESC to close modals
â€¢ Click outside the modal to close it

IMAGES:
-------
I've added beautiful stock images from Unsplash for each project.
You can replace these with your own project screenshots later by changing the URLs in the img src attributes.

CUSTOMIZATION:
--------------
â€¢ Change project images: Edit the <img src="..."> URLs in projects-section.html
â€¢ Modify colors: Edit the gradient in projects-overlay.css
â€¢ Add more projects: Copy one project-box div and modal, change the IDs

All animations, hover effects, and modal functionality are fully working!
The design is fully responsive and works on all devices.
